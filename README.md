**I am not responsible for any damage to anyones system. This is an experimental app and support is limited. Try it with your own percautions.**

##  Installation

I haven't tested on other distros yet.
For now i'm still focusing on the app itself so no installer on Flatpak or Appimage is available.

* **gtk** 

### Install
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SebTMo/Paperset.git
cd Paperset
meson setup build
sudo ninja -C build install
````
**The app is now installed**

### Compiling (portable variant)

Compile the files to an executable for one time use:

```bash
cd src/
gcc main.c -o paperset $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk4 libadwaita-1)
```

---

## Usage
If installed with Meson the app should be in the app menu or can be started in the terminal with:

```bash

```

Running the executable(Portable variant):

```bash
./paperset
```
